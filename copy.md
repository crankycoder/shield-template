Mozilla wants to know which performance settings are best for users.   Enable this study and help us find out!

## What Will Happen Next

**If you agree** to participate:

1. We will modify some settings in Firefox.
2. Continue using Firefox as you normally would.  You may notice changes.
3. After 7 days, the study will end on its own. Your Firefox will go back to normal.
4.  We will ask you to fill out a quick **optional survey** to tell us about your experience. The survey should take less than 5 minutes to complete.

## Leaving the Study

The study will expire on its own in 7 days.  You may leave the study early.  To do so, follow these steps:

1. Type `about:addons` into the url bar
2. Find `x-screen-draw-performance-shield-study-1` in the list
3. Click the `remove` button
4. If you opt out of the study early we will ask you to fill out a survey. We’re interested in hearing about your experience, even if you didn’t participate in the entire study.

Opting out of a study does not prevent you from participating in future studies.

## Data we will collect

- General Firefox Usage Data, in accord with the [Firefox Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/)
- Your responses to the followup survey

## Why Does Mozilla Do Studies?

Mozilla needs your help to build the future of Firefox.  Here at Mozilla we pride ourselves on building products not for ourselves, but for you the user! We can’t do this alone.

By participating in this study you will help us to make better decisions on your behalf. Your feedback will directly shape future versions of Firefox!

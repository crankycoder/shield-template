Mozilla wants to know which performance settings in Firefox work best for most users.   Start this study and help us figure them out!

## What will happen next

**If you agree** to participate:

1. We will modify some settings in Firefox.
2. Continue using Firefox as you normally would.  You may notice changes.
3. After 7 days, the study will end on its own. Your Firefox will go back to normal.
4.  We will ask you to fill out a quick **optional survey** to tell us about your experience. The survey should take less than 5 minutes to complete.

## Leaving the study

The study will expire on its own in 7 days.  You may leave the study early.  To do so, follow these steps:

1. Type `about:addons` into the location bar, and press enter.
2. Find `x-screen-draw-performance-shield-study-1` in the addons list.
3. Click the `remove` button.
4. If you opt out of the study early we will ask you to fill out a survey. We’re interested in hearing about your experience, even if you didn’t participate in the entire study.

Opting out of a study does not prevent you from participating in future studies.

## Data we will collect

- General Firefox Usage Data, in accordance with the [Firefox Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/)
- Your responses to the follow-up survey

## We can’t do this alone

At Mozilla, we pride ourselves on building products for you, the user! That’s why we need your help.

By participating in this study, you will help us to make better decisions on your behalf and directly shape future versions of Firefox!
